Downloading PyEnchant
=====================

Prerequisites
-------------

To get PyEnchant up and running, you will need the following software installed:

    * Python 2.3 or later, with the ctypes module installed.
          o Python 2.5 and higher include ctypes by default.
          o For older versions, it can be downloaded here.

          o For Mac OSX users, the experimental binary installers below include a pre-built copy of enchant.


Source Distribution
-------------------

PyEnchant is distributed using the Python "setuptools" framework. In most cases this works just like the standard "distutils" framework, but you may be interested in these notes on installing with setuptools. Basic instructions for building from source can also be found in the tutorial. The source is available for download in the following file:

    * pyenchant-1.6.5.tar.gz 


Windows Users
-------------

For convenience, Windows users are provided with a pre-built installation program which can be used to install PyEnchant.

    * pyenchant-1.6.5.win32.exe

There are also Python Eggs available for users who prefer them:

    * Python 2.5: pyenchant-1.6.5-py2.5-win32.egg
    * Python 2.6: pyenchant-1.6.5-py2.6-win32.egg

Users with Python versions less than 2.5 will also need to install the ctypes package. These pre-built distributions contain a compiled Enchant binary as well as several DLLs produced by Tor Lillqvist. In order to ensure compliance with the license for these supporting libraries, the sourcecode and supporting build environment is available for download in the following file:

    * pyenchant-bdist-win32-sources-1.6.5.tar.gz

Windows users can also follow the instructions above to build from source.
