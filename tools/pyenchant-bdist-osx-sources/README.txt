The PyEnchant binary distribution contains prebuilt libraries for
enchant and its dependencies.  This directory contains the source
for those libraries, in compliance with a strict interpretation
of the GPL/LGPL.

The enchant library is a very slightly modified version of the latest
enchant release, the patches can be found in the "patches" directory.

The remaining libraries are built unmodified.
