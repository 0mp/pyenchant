The PyEnchant binary distribution contains prebuilt libraries for
enchant and its dependencies.  This directory contains the source
for those libraries, in compliance with a struct interpretation
of the GPL/LGPL.

The enchant library is a modified version of enchant-1.1.5.  The
appropriate modifications are stored in enchant.c.patch.

The remaining libraries were built by Tor Lillqvist and were obtained
from his website at:
