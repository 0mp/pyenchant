PyEnchant:

  * test unicode support, hopefully get help from a user who speaks
    a language requiring Unicode
  * implement a tkSpellCheckerDialog to compliment the wx one
  * Expand CmdLineChecker and make it ispell-compatible
  * regression tests: Broker
  * Mark Dict.add_to_personal as deprecated sometime in future
  * look up default language somehow?
  * respect locale.getdefaultencoding()?
  * support for python2.2
      - done for Linux, needs testing under Windows
          - will probably require an updated distutils

  
Enchant:

  * find a way to avoid using the registry to record dict locations
     - augment the new binreloc code with calls to GetModuleFilename
  * move to aspell for windows installer backend if possible
