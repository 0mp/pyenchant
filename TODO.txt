PyEnchant:

  * test unicode support, hopefully get help from a user who speaks
    a language requiring Unicode
  * implement a tkSpellCheckerDialog to compliment the wx one
  * Expand CmdLineChecker and make it ispell-compatible
  * regression tests: Dict, Broker, DictWithPWL
  * Mark Dict.add_to_personal as deprecated sometime in future
  * better registry handling:
      - save into HKEY_LOCAL_USER rather than HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
      - check for broken entries and replace them with good ones

  
Enchant:

  * find a way to avoid using the registry to record dict locations
  * move to aspell for windows installer backend if possible
