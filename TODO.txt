Migration to ctypes:

   - confirm working on pypy-c, including fixing refcounting-based tests
   - use absolute imports everywhere, see if this allows __init__ to be run as a script
   - finish _EnchantString class implementation
   - try things out on Py3k

PyEnchant:

  * implement a tkSpellCheckerDialog to compliment the wx one
  * Expand CmdLineChecker and make it ispell-compatible
  * try things out on OSX
